This is my voice assistant. 
I am building this for my High School Capstone project.
This is my first real coding project so dont bully. :)

Functionality: these are the goals I have for this project.

    - I want the voice assistant to be able to respond to basic commands and reply with predetermined answers or run predetermind proccess.

    - The voice assistant will only accept commands after a special keyword is entered. (My plan for this is to use a https://dangerousthings.com/product/kbr1/ with my RFID tag so that only I can talk with assistant) Note: This password could be disabled if i wanted. I just think it would be cool to have the voice assistant start up when i put my hand on the pad.

    - The assistant should be able to interface with my computer in limided ways. (for example I want it to be able to run python scripts)


Yay I hope you enjoy this thing I cant wait till done.

If u want to help me I think ur cool
But I noob so dont judge LOL
